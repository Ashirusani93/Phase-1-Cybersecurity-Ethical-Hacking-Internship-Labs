## **INT304: Network Security and Protocols â€“ Lab 1: Introduction to Network Security Concepts**

### **Objectives**
- Understand fundamental concepts of network security.
- Identify different types of threats and vulnerabilities in network environments.
- Learn about security protocols and their roles in safeguarding network communications.

### **Lab Activities**

1. **Overview of Network Security**
   - Begin by reading the provided materials on the importance of network security. Focus on why organizations must prioritize securing their networks.
   - Discuss various types of network attacks, including:
     - **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Flooding a network to make it unavailable.
     - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepting communication between two parties.
     - **Phishing**: Deceiving individuals into providing sensitive information.

2. **Identifying Threats and Vulnerabilities**
   - Conduct a group exercise where each group is given a hypothetical network scenario (e.g., a small business, a university campus).
   - Identify potential threats in the given scenarios, discussing what types of attacks could be launched and the vulnerabilities present in the network architecture.

3. **Understanding Security Protocols**
   - Review key security protocols and their functions:
     - **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)**: Protects data transmitted over the internet, ensuring that communication remains private and secure.
     - **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)**: A suite of protocols designed to secure Internet Protocol (IP) communications through encryption and authentication.
     - **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services.
     - **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: An extension of HTTP, using SSL/TLS to secure communications over a computer network.
   - Discuss how each protocol operates and in what situations they are typically used.

4. **Hands-On Activity**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to a secure website (e.g., https://www.example.com).
   - Click on the padlock icon in the address bar to view the SSL/TLS certificate details.
     - Record the certificate issuer, validity period, and encryption strength used for the connection.
   - Discuss findings with your peers about the significance of having secure connections in everyday internet use.

5. **Group Discussion**
   - Facilitate a discussion on the importance of network security in modern businesses.
   - Encourage participants to share insights from the hands-on activity and how analyzing SSL/TLS certificates can impact security practices.

### **Deliverables**
- Compile a brief report (1-2 pages) summarizing your findings from the lab activities. Include:
  - Key threats and vulnerabilities identified during the group exercise.
  - A summary of each discussed security protocol.
  - Insights gained from analyzing the SSL/TLS certificate.

### **Deadline**
- The report should be submitted by the specified due date, which will be communicated in class.
