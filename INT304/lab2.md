## **INT304: Network Security and Protocols – Lab 2: Network Security Policies and Risk Management**

### **Objectives**
- Understand the importance of network security policies.
- Learn how to conduct a risk assessment.
- Develop skills to create effective security policies for an organization.

### **Lab Activities**

1. **Introduction to Network Security Policies**
   - Start with a reading assignment on network security policies and their significance in safeguarding organizational assets.
   - Discuss the key components of an effective security policy, including:
     - **Purpose and Scope**: What the policy aims to protect.
     - **User Responsibilities**: Expectations and acceptable use of network resources.
     - **Incident Response Plan**: Steps to take when a security breach occurs.
     - **Compliance**: Adherence to relevant laws and regulations.

2. **Conducting a Risk Assessment**
   - Break into small groups and select a hypothetical organization (e.g., a healthcare provider, a financial institution).
   - Each group should identify potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to their chosen organization.
   - Conduct a risk assessment using the following steps:
     - **Asset Identification**: List key assets that require protection (e.g., customer data, intellectual property).
     - **Threat Identification**: Identify potential threats to each asset (e.g., cyberattacks, natural disasters).
     - **Vulnerability Assessment**: Analyze weaknesses that could be exploited by threats.
     - **Impact Analysis**: Evaluate the potential impact of each threat on the organization.
     - **Risk Rating**: Assign a risk rating (high, medium, low) based on likelihood and impact.

3. **Developing Security Policies**
   - Using the findings from the risk assessment, each group will draft a preliminary security policy tailored to their organization. Key elements to include:
     - **Access Control Policies**: Guidelines for user access and authentication.
     - **Data Protection Policies**: Measures to safeguard sensitive information.
     - **Incident Response Procedures**: Steps to be taken in the event of a security incident.
     - **Training and Awareness Programs**: Plans for educating employees about security best practices.

4. **Presentation of Policies**
   - Each group will present their risk assessment and proposed security policy to the class.
   - Encourage peer feedback and discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each policy.

5. **Reflection and Discussion**
   - Hold a class discussion on the importance of adapting security policies to changing threats and organizational needs.
   - Discuss how organizations can regularly review and update their security policies to remain effective.

### **Deliverables**
- Each group will submit a comprehensive report (3-5 pages) that includes:
  - The completed risk assessment for the chosen organization.
  - The drafted security policy with all key components.
  - A summary of feedback received during the presentation.

### **Deadline**
- The report should be submitted by the specified due date, which will be communicated in class.
