Here’s an updated version of your lab instructions with the report submission section added:

## **INT308: Session Management and Web Security – Lab 1: Session Management Vulnerabilities**

### **Overview**
In this lab, you will explore session management vulnerabilities, focusing on how insecure session handling can lead to unauthorized access and session hijacking. You will learn to identify weaknesses in session management practices and understand the importance of secure session management in web applications.

### **Prerequisites**
- Familiarity with web application security concepts.
- Ensure you have access to a web application environment that has known session management vulnerabilities (e.g., DVWA or a similar platform).

### **Lab Objectives**
- Understand how sessions are created, maintained, and terminated in web applications.
- Identify common session management vulnerabilities.
- Learn to exploit insecure session management practices.

### **Exercise Instructions**

#### **Exercise 1: Analyzing Session Management Practices**

1. **Access the Target Application**:
   - Open the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) in your browser.

2. **Login to the Application**:
   - Navigate to the login page and authenticate using valid credentials. Observe the session cookie generated upon successful login.

3. **Inspect the Session Cookie**:
   - Use the browser’s developer tools (F12) to inspect the session cookie set by the application. Take note of its attributes such as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite`.

4. **Reflection**:
   - Discuss the implications of the cookie attributes. What vulnerabilities can arise from improperly configured session cookies?

#### **Exercise 2: Session Fixation Attack**

1. **Understand Session Fixation**:
   - Read about session fixation attacks, where an attacker sets a user's session ID to a known value, allowing them to hijack the session.

2. **Simulate a Session Fixation Attack**:
   - As a hypothetical exercise (or in a controlled lab environment), modify the session ID in your browser's developer tools to a predetermined value before logging into the application.
   - After logging in, switch to another tab or browser session and use the known session ID to see if you can access the authenticated session.

3. **Reflection**:
   - Analyze how the application handled session management. Was it possible to hijack the session? Discuss the importance of regenerating session IDs after login.

#### **Exercise 3: Session Hijacking Using Burp Suite**

1. **Set Up Burp Suite**:
   - Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.

2. **Capture and Modify Session Requests**:
   - Log in to the application and capture the session management request in Burp Suite.
   - Modify the session ID value in the request and forward it.

3. **Observe the Response**:
   - Check if you can gain unauthorized access to the authenticated session.

4. **Reflection**:
   - Discuss the effectiveness of session management in the application. What measures can be implemented to prevent session hijacking?

### **Report Submission**
At the end of this lab, you are required to submit a report summarizing your findings and reflections from each exercise. Your report should include:

- An overview of the session management vulnerabilities explored.
- Detailed reflections from each exercise, including any vulnerabilities identified and potential mitigation strategies.
- Screenshots or code snippets where applicable to support your observations.
- Any additional insights or recommendations for improving session management practices.

**Submission Format**: Submit your report as a PDF file. Ensure that it is well-organized and clearly addresses each part of the lab.

---

### **Conclusion**
In this lab, you explored various session management vulnerabilities, including insecure session handling practices, session fixation, and session hijacking. Understanding these concepts is crucial for implementing secure session management in web applications.

### **Next Steps**
- Review the OWASP guidelines on secure session management practices.
- Prepare for the next lab, which will focus on mitigating these vulnerabilities and implementing secure session management strategies.
