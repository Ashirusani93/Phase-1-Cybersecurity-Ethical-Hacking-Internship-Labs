# INT307 Web Application Security Lab 5: Security Misconfiguration in DVWA/Mutillidae

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore various security misconfigurations that can occur in web applications, specifically in the context of DVWA or Mutillidae. Security misconfiguration refers to a broad range of issues that arise when security settings are not properly defined, implemented, or maintained. These misconfigurations can leave applications vulnerable to attacks and exploitation.

### Objectives

1. Identify common security misconfigurations in DVWA/Mutillidae.
2. Exploit vulnerabilities arising from these misconfigurations.
3. Discuss best practices for securing web applications against misconfiguration risks.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure DVWA or Mutillidae is installed and running.
- Familiarize yourself with BurpSuite and its features for testing web applications.

## Exercise Instructions

### **Exercise 1: Default Credentials and Permissions**

**Objective:** Identify and exploit vulnerabilities arising from default credentials and permissions.

1. **Access the Application**: Open DVWA or Mutillidae in your web browser.

2. **Default Credentials**:
   - Attempt to log in using the default credentials.
   - For DVWA, try `admin` / `password` or check for documentation to find defaults.
   - For Mutillidae, check if default credentials are specified.

3. **Reflection**:
   - What was the result of using default credentials? 
   - Discuss why using default credentials is a significant security risk.

### **Exercise 2: Directory Listing**

**Objective:** Investigate the impact of directory listing enabled on the web server.

1. **Check for Directory Listing**:
   - Navigate to a known directory on DVWA/Mutillidae (e.g., `/uploads/` or `/images/`).
   - Observe if directory listing is enabled (i.e., you can see a list of files).

2. **Reflection**:
   - What files can you see in the directory listing?
   - Discuss how directory listing can expose sensitive information or files that can be exploited.

---

### **Exercise 3: Error Handling Misconfiguration**

**Objective:** Identify information leakage through error messages.

1. **Induce an Error**:
   - Try to access a non-existent page (e.g., `/vulnerabilities/invalid_page`).
   - Observe the error message generated by the application.

2. **Reflection**:
   - What information is displayed in the error message?
   - Discuss how detailed error messages can aid an attacker in exploiting vulnerabilities.

---

### **Exercise 4: Security Headers**

**Objective:** Check for the presence and configuration of security headers.

1. **Analyze Security Headers**:
   - Use BurpSuite or your browser's developer tools to inspect the HTTP response headers of the application.
   - Check for the presence of security headers such as:
     - `X-Content-Type-Options`
     - `X-Frame-Options`
     - `Content-Security-Policy`
     - `Strict-Transport-Security`

2. **Reflection**:
   - Are there any missing security headers?
   - Discuss the importance of these headers and how they can mitigate certain attacks.

---

### **Exercise 5: Insecure File Upload Configuration**

**Objective:** Explore the risks of insecure file upload configurations.

1. **Access File Upload Feature**:
   - Navigate to the file upload functionality in DVWA or Mutillidae.

2. **Attempt to Upload a Malicious File**:
   - Create a simple web shell (e.g., a PHP script) that you can use to gain access.
   - Try to upload the file and observe the application's response.

3. **Reflection**:
   - Were you able to upload the file? 
   - Discuss the implications of allowing arbitrary file uploads and how to mitigate this risk.

---

## Conclusion

In this lab, you have learned about various security misconfigurations that can occur in web applications, how to identify and exploit them, and the implications of these misconfigurations on application security. Understanding and addressing security misconfigurations is essential for maintaining a secure web application.

### Report Submission

After completing the lab exercises, submit a report summarizing your findings, including:
- The vulnerabilities identified.
- The methods used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- Recommendations for securing the application against these types of misconfigurations.
