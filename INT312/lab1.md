## **INT312 - Basic Networking Skills for Digital Forensics – Lab 1**

### **Lab Title:**  
**Creating a Simple Website and Capturing Network Traffic**

---

### **Objective:**
This lab aims to introduce you to basic web development and network traffic analysis. You will create a simple website that displays your name and use Wireshark to capture network traffic generated by accessing this website. By the end of this lab, you will understand fundamental concepts of network protocols and traffic analysis essential for digital forensics.

### **Part 1: Create a Simple Website**

1. **Website Creation:**
   - Design a basic HTML page with the following content:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Your Name's Website</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Hello, My Name is [Your Name]</h1>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - Save the file as `index.html`.

2. **Hosting the Website on Linux Using Apache:**
   - **Step 1:** Install Apache if it’s not already installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install apache2
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Move your HTML file to the Apache web directory:
     ```bash
     sudo cp index.html /var/www/html/
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Set the appropriate permissions (if needed):
     ```bash
     sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/index.html
     sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html
     ```
   - **Step 4:** Start the Apache service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start apache2
     sudo systemctl enable apache2
     ```
   - **Step 5:** Open your web browser and navigate to your server's IP address (or `http://localhost` if you're accessing it locally). You should see your website displaying your name.

### **Part 2: Capture Network Traffic**

1. **Set Up Wireshark:**
   - Open Wireshark and select the appropriate network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet) to capture traffic.
   - Start capturing packets before accessing your website.

2. **Access Your Website:**
   - In a web browser, navigate to your hosted website (e.g., `http://localhost/index.html`).

### **Part 3: Capture Screenshots with Required Information**

1. **Information to Capture:**
   - Take screenshots of the following data from Wireshark and your web browser:
     - **The website displaying your name.**
     - **Ports used (sender and receiver):** Identify the source and destination ports in the TCP packets.
     - **Initial sequence numbers (sender and receiver):** Locate the sequence numbers in the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) packets.
     - **Timestamps of the TCP handshake:** Note the timestamps of the SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets.
     - **IP addresses (sender and receiver):** Identify your machine's IP address and the localhost address.
     - **MAC addresses (sender and receiver):** Capture the Ethernet frame details to find the MAC addresses.
     - **Timestamps of the HTTP request:** Note the timestamp of the HTTP GET request packet.

2. **Repeat the Process with External Site:**
   - Access the website: `http://shinyfreshmajesticsmile.neverssl.com/online/`.
   - Capture the same information as above for this website.

---

### **Submission Requirements:**

- Submit a PDF file containing:
  - Screenshots of the website displaying your name and the traffic captured in Wireshark.
  - Answers to any questions posed in the process.
  - Documentation of the ports, IP addresses, MAC addresses, timestamps, and sequence numbers.

- Ensure that your file is well-organized and includes your name and student ID at the top of the document.

---

### **Grading Criteria:**

- **Correctness:** Accuracy of captured information and analysis.
- **Clarity:** Clear explanations of processes and captured data.
- **Documentation:** Thorough and clear documentation of steps and findings.
- **Presentation:** Well-organized submission with proper formatting.

---

### **Important Notes:**

- This lab is designed to provide practical experience with web development and network traffic analysis.
- Feel free to explore additional features of your local web server or Wireshark to deepen your understanding. However, ensure that all required tasks are completed for submission.

Good luck with your lab!
