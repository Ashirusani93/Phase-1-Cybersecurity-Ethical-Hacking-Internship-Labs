### **Part 1: Understanding Linux for Digital Forensics**

1. **Good and Bad Aspects of Linux in Digital Forensics:**
   - Discuss the advantages of using Linux for digital forensics, such as its open-source nature, powerful command-line tools, and extensive community support.
   - Address the potential challenges, including compatibility issues with certain file systems and software, and the learning curve for users new to Linux.

   **Task:**
   - Write a brief summary of at least two advantages and two challenges of using Linux for digital forensics.

### **Part 2: Virtual File System and File Structure**

1. **Virtual File System (VFS):**
   - Explain what a Virtual File System is and its role in Linux.
   - Discuss how VFS allows Linux to support multiple file systems seamlessly.

2. **File Structure:**
   - Describe the hierarchical file structure in Linux and the significance of the root directory (`/`).

   **Task:**
   - Create a diagram representing the Linux file structure, highlighting key directories such as `/home`, `/etc`, `/usr`, and `/var`.

---

### **Part 3: Path and Path Variable**

1. **Path Variable:**
   - Define what the path variable is in Linux and its importance in executing commands.

   **Task:**
   - Display the current path variable by executing the command:
     ```bash
     echo $PATH
     ```
   - Add a new directory (e.g., **`/home/yourusername/scripts`**) to the path variable temporarily for the session:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/home/yourusername/scripts
     ```

   **Task:**
   - Confirm the new path by executing the **`echo $PATH`** command again.

---

### **Part 4: Essential Linux Commands**

1. **Creating Folders and Files:**
   - Use the following commands to create a new directory named **`forensics_lab`** and create two text files within it:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/forensics_lab
     touch ~/forensics_lab/file1.txt ~/forensics_lab/file2.txt
     ```

2. **File Copying and Deletion:**
   - Copy **`file1.txt`** to a new file named **`file1_copy.txt`**:
     ```bash
     cp ~/forensics_lab/file1.txt ~/forensics_lab/file1_copy.txt
     ```
   - Delete **`file2.txt`**:
     ```bash
     rm ~/forensics_lab/file2.txt
     ```

   **Task:**
   - Verify that the copy and deletion were successful by listing the contents of the **`forensics_lab`** directory:
     ```bash
     ls ~/forensics_lab
     ```

---

### **Part 5: Searching for Information**

1. **Searching for Files:**
   - Use the `find` command to search for all `.txt` files in the **`forensics_lab`** directory:
     ```bash
     find ~/forensics_lab -name "*.txt"
     ```

   **Task:**
   - Document the output of the command and explain what it shows.

---

### **Part 6: Networking in Linux**

1. **Basic Networking Commands:**
   - Execute the following commands to gather network information:
     - **`ifconfig`**: Display network interfaces and their configurations.
     - **`ping google.com`**: Check connectivity to Google's servers.
     - **`traceroute google.com`**: Trace the route to Google.
   - Use **nmap** to scan the localhost for port 21:
     ```bash
     nmap localhost -p 21
     ```

   - Use **netcat** to set up a simple TCP connection:
     ```bash
     nc -l -p 12345
     ```
   - Use **wget** to download an image:
     ```bash
     wget https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DulILzQXcAAkFMV.jpg
     ```

   **Task:**
   - Document the outputs of these commands and explain the significance of the information provided.

---

### **Part 7: File Management**

1. **Zipping and Unzipping Files:**
   - Create a compressed archive of the **`forensics_lab`** directory:
     ```bash
     zip -r forensics_lab.zip ~/forensics_lab
     ```
   - Unzip the created archive into a new directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir ~/uncompressed_lab
     unzip forensics_lab.zip -d ~/uncompressed_lab
     ```

   **Task:**
   - Verify the contents of the uncompressed directory to ensure all files were restored correctly:
     ```bash
     ls ~/uncompressed_lab
     ```

---

### **Part 8: Creating a Shell Script**

1. **Creating a Shell Script:**
   - Create a shell script named **`sys_info.sh`** with the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "System Information:"
   uname -a
   free -h
   df -h
   ```
   - Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/forensics_lab/sys_info.sh
   ```

   **Task:**
   - Run the script from the terminal:
   ```bash
   ~/forensics_lab/sys_info.sh
   ```

   - Document the output observed from executing the script.

### **Part 9: Installing Software**

1. **Installing Terminator:**
   - Use the following command to install **Terminator**, a terminal emulator:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install terminator
   ```

   **Task:**
   - Document the installation steps and any outputs observed during the installation process.

---

### **Part 10: Updating/Installing Software**

1. **Updating Software:**
