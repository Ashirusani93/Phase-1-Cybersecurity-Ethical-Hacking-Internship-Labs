### **Part 3: Hard Disk Drives**

1. **Disk Drive Components:**
   - Identify and describe the main components of a hard disk drive (HDD), including platters, read/write heads, and actuators.

2. **Disk Geometry Calculation:**
   - Given the following parameters:
     - Sectors per track: `500`
     - Number of heads: `10`
     - Cylinders: `12,000`
   
   **Tasks:**
   a. Calculate the total number of sectors on the disk.  
   b. Discuss how the design of HDDs affects performance and data retrieval times.

### **Part 4: Calculate Disk Partitions**

1. **Understanding Partitions:**
   - Explain the concept of disk partitions and their purpose in a computer system.

2. **Partition Calculation Exercise:**
   - If a hard drive has a total capacity of `1 TB` and is divided into the following partitions:
     - System partition: `200 GB`
     - Data partition: `600 GB`
     - Recovery partition: `200 GB`
   
   **Question:**  
   Calculate the percentage of disk space used for each partition and the total free space available on the disk.

### **Part 5: PC Boot Process**

1. **Boot Sequence:**
   - Outline the steps involved in the PC boot process, from powering on the computer to loading the operating system.
   
   **Question:**  
   What role does the BIOS/UEFI play in the boot process, and how does it interact with the operating system?

2. **Boot Troubleshooting:**
   - Identify common issues that can occur during the boot process and provide solutions or troubleshooting steps for each.

### **Part 6: File Systems**

1. **File System Overview:**
   - Define what a file system is and its role in data management within a computer system.

2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare and contrast at least three different file systems (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, EXT4) in terms of their structure, advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.
   
   **Question:**  
   Which file system would you recommend for a specific application (e.g., for a personal computer, a server, or an embedded system) and why?

---

### **Submission Requirements:**

- Submit a PDF document containing:
  - Answers to all questions and discussion points.
  - Diagrams or illustrations where appropriate (e.g., computer architecture, disk drive components).
  - Any calculations or findings related to disk partitions and geometry.
  
- Ensure that your file is organized with a clear layout, including your name and student ID at the top.

---

### **Grading Criteria:**

- **Correctness:** Accuracy of answers, calculations, and explanations.
- **Clarity:** Well-articulated descriptions and logical flow of information.
- **Depth:** Thoroughness of research and understanding of complex topics.
- **Documentation:** Clear presentation of findings with appropriate use of diagrams or illustrations.
