# Lab 1: Investigate Kali Linux

## Objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following objectives:
- Familiarize yourself with the Kali Linux GUI.
- Familiarize yourself with the Kali Linux shell.
- Understand basic file and directory operations.
- Learn about file permissions and how to manipulate them.

## Background / Scenario
Linux is an open-source operating system known for its speed, reliability, and efficiency. It can run on minimal hardware resources and is highly customizable. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows and Mac OS X, Linux is maintained by a community of developers, making it adaptable for various applications, from embedded devices to supercomputers.

Kali Linux is a specialized distribution designed for security auditing and penetration testing. It includes numerous tools for these tasks, but it is not intended for everyday use like gaming or general development. As a cybersecurity professional, it’s crucial to be adept at navigating both the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line in Kali Linux.

## Required Resources
- Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) customized for the Ethical Hacker course.
- Internet access.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Kali Linux GUI

#### Step 1: Start the VM and learn about the Kali GUI
1. **Log In**: Start your Kali VM and log in with the username `kali` and the password `kali`. You should see the Kali desktop.
2. **Explore the Desktop**:
   - The desktop contains icons like the trash, file explorer, and application links.
   - The top panel includes running application icons and allows you to switch between different desktops, each of which can have unique configurations.
3. **Customize the Panel**:
   - Right-click the panel, select `Panel`, then `+ Add New Items…` to explore options for adding frequently used items.
   - Access `Panel Preferences…` to adjust the appearance and functionality of the panel. Experiment with the settings and then close the windows.
4. **Access Settings**: The top-right corner displays settings and system information, including network status and power options.

#### Step 2: Navigate the Applications Menu
1. **Open the Applications Menu**: Click the first icon on the left side of the panel to access the Applications menu, similar to the Start menu in Windows.
2. **Explore Applications**: Browse through the categories, examining the various tools available in Kali Linux, particularly those related to security.
3. **Open a Terminal**: Close any application windows and click the square black-and-white icon in the panel to open a terminal for the next part of the lab.

### Part 2: Familiarize Yourself with the Kali Linux Shell
The shell (or terminal) is a powerful interface for interacting with the Linux operating system.

#### Step 1: Command Documentation
1. **Learn About the Man Page**:
   - In the terminal, type:
     ```bash
     man man
     ```
   - This command displays documentation about the `man` command. Use `q` to exit the man page.
   - **Question**: Name a few sections included in a man page.

2. **Basic Commands**:
   The following table lists some basic Linux commands and their functions:

   | Command   | Description                                                           |
   |-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | mv        | Moves or renames files and directories.                               |
   | chmod     | Modifies file permissions.                                            |
   | chown     | Changes the ownership of a file.                                      |
   | dd        | Copies data from an input to an output.                              |
   | pwd       | Displays the name of the current directory.                          |
   | ps        | Lists the processes currently running in the system.                |
   | su        | Simulates a login as another user or to become a superuser.         |
   | sudo      | Runs a command as a superuser or another named user.                |
   | grep      | Searches for specific strings of characters within a file.           |
   | ifconfig  | Displays or configures network card information (deprecated; use `ip address`). |
   | apt-get   | Installs, configures, and removes packages on Debian-based systems.  |
   | iwconfig  | Displays or configures wireless network card information.            |
   | shutdown  | Shuts down the computer or performs related tasks.                   |
   | passwd    | Changes the password for the current user.                           |
   | cat       | Lists the contents of a file.                                        |

#### Step 2: Create and Change Directories
In this step, you will use the `cd`, `mkdir`, and `ls` commands.

1. **Print the Current Working Directory**:
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```

   **Question**: What is the current directory?
   **Answer Area**
   <!----><!---->

2. **Navigate to the `/home/kali` Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/kali
   ```

3. **List Files in the Current Directory**:
   ```bash
   ls -l
   ```

4. **Create a New Directory**:

   ls
   ```

### Part 3: Copying and Moving Files
1. **Copy a File**:
   To copy a file, use the `cp` command. For example, to copy `gvm_admin_passwd.txt` to `backup_gvm_passwd.txt`:
   ```bash
   cp gvm_admin_passwd.txt backup_gvm_passwd.txt
   ```

2. **Verify the Copy**:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

3. **Move a File**:

   ```bash
   mv gvm_admin_passwd.txt Documents/
   ```

4. **Verify the Move**:
   ```bash
   ls Documents/

   To delete `backup_gvm_passwd.txt`:
   ```bash
   rm backup_gvm_passwd.txt
   ```

2. **Verify Deletion**:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

### Part 5: Viewing File Content
1. **View File Contents**:
   To view the contents of a file:
   ```bash
   cat gvm_admin_passwd.txt
   ```

2. **Paginated Viewing**:
   If the file is long, use `less` for paginated viewing:
   ```bash
   less gvm_admin_passwd.txt
   ```
