# Lab 1: Introduction to Linux Basics

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of the Linux operating system. By the end of this lab, you will be comfortable navigating the Linux command line, managing files and directories, and understanding file permissions, which are essential skills for anyone pursuing a career in cybersecurity.

## Prerequisites
- A running instance of Kali Linux or any Linux distribution.
- Access to the terminal application (often found in the applications menu).

## Lab Overview
This lab consists of the following sections:
1. Basic Linux commands
2. File and directory manipulation
3. Understanding file permissions
4. Viewing and editing text files

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Linux Commands
1. **Open the Terminal**: Locate the terminal icon in your applications or press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
2. **Execute Basic Commands**:
   - `pwd`: Displays the current working directory (where you are in the file system).
   - `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory. Try `ls -l` for detailed information (permissions, owner, size).
   - `cd /path/to/directory`: Change to a specified directory. Use both absolute (full path) and relative (from current location) paths to navigate.
   - `mkdir test_directory`: Create a new directory named `test_directory`.
   - `rmdir test_directory`: Remove the directory you just created. Ensure it’s empty first; otherwise, use `rm -r test_directory` to delete it recursively.

### Exercise 2: File and Directory Manipulation
1. **Create a New Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir lab1_files
   ```
   This creates a directory called `lab1_files`.
   
2. **Change into the New Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd lab1_files
   ```
   You are now in the `lab1_files` directory.

3. **Create Text Files**:
   ```bash
   touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   ```
   This command creates three empty text files.

4. **List Files**:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   Verify that your files were created successfully.

5. **Rename a File**:
   ```bash
   mv file1.txt file_renamed.txt
   ```
   This renames `file1.txt` to `file_renamed.txt`.

6. **Delete a File**:
   ```bash
   rm file2.txt
   ```
   This deletes `file2.txt`. Use `ls` again to confirm it’s gone.

### Exercise 3: Viewing and Editing Files
1. **Add Text to a File**:
   ```bash
   echo "This is my first file!" > file_renamed.txt
   ```
   This command writes the specified text into `file_renamed.txt`.

2. **View File Contents**:
   ```bash
   cat file_renamed.txt
   ```
   This displays the contents of the file.

3. **Edit the File with Nano**:
   ```bash
   nano file_renamed.txt
   ```
   - In the Nano editor, make any changes you like.
   - To save and exit, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to confirm saving, and press `Enter`.

### Exercise 4: Understanding File Permissions
1. **Check File Permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -l file_renamed.txt
   ```
   This shows detailed information about the file, including permissions.

2. **Change File Permissions**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 file_renamed.txt
   ```
   This command changes permissions so that only the owner can read and write the file.

3. **Verify Permission Changes**:
   ```bash
   ls -l file_renamed.txt
   ```
   Confirm the permissions have been updated as expected.

## Conclusion
In this lab, you have learned how to effectively navigate the Linux file system, manage files and directories, view and edit text files, and manipulate file permissions. Mastering these skills is crucial for your further exploration into Linux and the field of cybersecurity.
