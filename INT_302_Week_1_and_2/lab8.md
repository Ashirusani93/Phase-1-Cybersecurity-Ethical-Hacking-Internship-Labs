## **INT302: Kali Linux Tools and System Security – Lab 8: Web Application Security Testing with Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP**

### **Lab Overview**
In this lab, participants will learn how to use Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) to perform web application security testing. These tools will enable you to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.

---

### **Lab Objectives**
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Configure and set up Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for web application testing.
2. Perform basic web application scanning and vulnerability assessment.
3. Identify and exploit common vulnerabilities in web applications.
4. Document and report findings effectively.

---

### **Tools Used**
- **Burp Suite**: A web application security testing tool.
- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source web application security scanner.

---

### **Prerequisites**
- Basic understanding of web technologies (HTML, HTTP, etc.).
- Familiarity with the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities.

---

### **Lab Steps**

#### **Step 1: Setting Up Burp Suite**

1. **Launch Burp Suite**:
   - Start Burp Suite from your Kali Linux environment.
   - Choose the Community edition for this lab.

2. **Configure Browser to Use Burp Proxy**:
   - Set up your browser (Firefox or Chrome) to route traffic through Burp Suite:
     - Go to your browser settings.
     - Configure the proxy settings to use `127.0.0.1` and port `8080`.

3. **Intercepting Traffic**:
   - Ensure that the "Intercept" feature is turned on in Burp Suite.
   - Visit any web application, like [http://testphp.vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com), to observe how Burp Suite captures and displays the traffic.

**Exercise 1**:  
- Document the HTTP request and response headers for the home page of the target application. What information do you find in these headers? __________

---

#### **Step 2: Using Burp Suite for Vulnerability Scanning**

1. **Spidering the Application**:
   - Use the Spider tool in Burp Suite to crawl the application and gather all available URLs.
   - Right-click on the target site in the site map and select "Spider this host."

**Exercise 2**:  
- List the URLs discovered during the spidering process. Did you find any hidden or interesting pages? __________

2. **Active Scanning**:
   - After spidering, select the site and choose "Scan" to start an active scan.
   - Review the scan results to identify any vulnerabilities found.

**Exercise 3**:  
- What vulnerabilities were detected by Burp Suite? Choose one vulnerability and explain how it could be exploited. __________

---

#### **Step 3: Setting Up OWASP ZAP**

1. **Launch OWASP ZAP**:
   - Start OWASP ZAP from your Kali Linux environment.

2. **Configure Proxy Settings**:
   - Similar to Burp Suite, configure your browser to route traffic through OWASP ZAP using `127.0.0.1` and port `8080`.

3. **Intercepting Traffic**:
   - Visit the same web application used in Burp Suite while OWASP ZAP is running.

**Exercise 4**:  
- Capture and analyze the traffic with OWASP ZAP. What differences do you notice compared to Burp Suite? __________

---

#### **Step 4: Using OWASP ZAP for Vulnerability Scanning**

1. **Automated Scanner**:
   - Utilize the “Quick Start” feature to run an automated scan on the target web application.
   - Monitor the alerts generated by ZAP during the scan.

**Exercise 5**:  
- Review the vulnerabilities identified by OWASP ZAP. Which tools detected the same vulnerabilities? What are the potential impacts of these vulnerabilities? __________

2. **Active Scan**:
   - Perform an active scan by selecting the target site and initiating the scan.
   - Review the detailed reports generated.

**Exercise 6**:  
- Compare the findings of OWASP ZAP with Burp Suite. Which tool provided more detailed information? Which tool do you prefer for vulnerability scanning? Why? __________

---

#### **Step 5: Manual Testing Techniques**

1. **Fuzzing**:
   - Use both tools to perform fuzzing against input fields in the web application (e.g., login forms, search fields).
   - Attempt to inject various payloads to test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS.

**Exercise 7**:  
- Document any successful injections or errors encountered during fuzzing. What techniques were effective? __________

2. **Review and Documentation**:
   - Create a report summarizing your findings from both tools, including:
     - Identified vulnerabilities.
     - Suggested mitigations.
     - Screenshots of significant findings.

**Exercise 8**:  
- Prepare a report detailing the vulnerabilities discovered, your methodology, and recommendations for securing the application. __________

---

### **Conclusion**
In this lab, you gained hands-on experience using Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP for web application security testing. You learned how to identify vulnerabilities and apply various testing techniques to assess the security of web applications effectively.
